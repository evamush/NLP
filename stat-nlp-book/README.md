# The Stat-NLP-Book Project

## Render Book Statically

The easiest option for reading the book is via the static [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uclmr/stat-nlp-book/blob/python/overview.ipynb). 
While this does not allow you to change and execute code, it also doesn't require you to install software locally and only needs a browser.


## Docker installation 

We assume you have a command line interface (CLI) in your OS 
(bash, zsh, cygwin, git-bash, power-shell etc.). We assume this CLI sets 
 the variable `$(pwd)` to the current directory. If it doesn't replace
 all mentions of `$(pwd)` with the current directory you are in. 

### Install Docker

Go to the [docker webpage](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the instruction for your platform.

### Download Stat-NLP-Book Image

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

Next you can download the `stat-nlp-book` docker image like so:

    docker pull riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book
    
### Get Stat-NLP-Book Repository

You can use the git installation in the docker container to get the repository:

    docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/jovyan/work riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book git clone https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book.git  

Note: this will create a new `stat-nlp-book` directory in your current directory.

### Change into Stat-NLP-Book directory

We assume from here on that you are in the top level `stat-nlp-book` directory:

    cd stat-nlp-book

Note: you need to be in the `stat-nlp-book` directory every time you want to run/update the book.

### Run Notebook

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd)":/home/jovyan/work riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book 

You are now ready to visit the [overview page](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/overview.ipynb) of the installed book. 

## Usage

Once installed you can always run your notebook server by first changing
into your local `stat-nlp-book` directory, and then executing:

    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd)":/home/jovyan/work riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book 
    
This is **assuming that your docker daemon is running** and that you are
**in the `stat-nlp-book` directory**. How to run the docker daemon
depends on your system.

### Update the notebook

We frequently make changes to the book. To get these changes you
should first make sure to clean your *local changes* to avoid merge 
conflicts. That is, you might have made changes (by changing the code
or simply running it) to the files that we changed. In these cases `git`
 will complain when you do the update. To overcome this you can undo all
 your changes by executing:
 
    docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/jovyan/work riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book git checkout -- .
    
If you want to keep your changes **create copies of the changed files**.
Jupyter has a "Make a copy" option in the "File" menu for this. You can also create a clone of this repository
to keep your own changes and merge our changes in a more controlled manner. 

To get the actual updates then run

    docker run -v "$(pwd)":/home/jovyan/work riedelcastro/stat-nlp-book git pull
    
### Access Content

The repository contains a lot of material, some of which may not be ready
for consumption yet. This is why you should always access content through
the top-level [overview page (local-link)](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/overview.ipynb).



## virtualenv installation [BETA]

### Install virtualenv
Follow the instructions [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
In short:

    pip3 install virtualenv

### git clone the stat-nlp-book repository

    git clone https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book.git

### Create virtual environment
Enter the cloned stat-nlp-book directory:

    cd stat-nlp-book

and create the virtual environment:

    virtualenv -p python3 venv

### Enter the virtual environment

    source venv/bin/activate

### Install dependencies

    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install git+git://github.com/robjstan/tikzmagic.git
    jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
    jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix    

### Run the notebook

    jupyter notebook
    

## Installation on the UCL CS cluster
### Install virtualenv
When installing virtualenv (full instructions here [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)) on the CS cluster you will likely have to install it with the `--user` flag. In short:

    pip3 install --user virtualenv
    
At this point `virtualenv` may not yet directly be found. You can solve this by finding its location via

    pip3 show virtualenv
    
then appending the LOCATION shown (a directory name) to your $PATH variable using
    
    export PATH=$PATH:LOCATION
    
and giving permission to execute via

    chmod u=rwx LOCATION/virtualenv.py
    
You should then be able to run `virtualenv.py`. You can check this by running
    
    virtualenv.py --version

### git clone the stat-nlp-book repository
Now we're ready to clone the notebook:

    git clone https://github.com/uclmr/stat-nlp-book.git
    
### Create virtual environment
Enter the cloned stat-nlp-book directory via

    cd stat-nlp-book

and create the virtual environment:

    virtualenv.py -p python3 venv

### Enter the virtual environment

    source venv/bin/activate
    
    
### Install dependencies

    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    pip3 install git+git://github.com/robjstan/tikzmagic.git
    jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
    jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix

### Run the notebook

    jupyter notebook
    
    
### Access in local browser
With the notebook running on the UCL CS cluster, you can also access it locally via first setting up an SSH tunnel 

    # run this on your local machine
    ssh -N -f -L localhost:8157:localhost:8888 username@cs_cluster

and accessing it through your local browser by entering 
    
    localhost:8157
    
into the browser address bar.
