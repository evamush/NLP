    "In the last assignment, you will apply deep learning methods to solve a particular story understanding problem. Automatic understanding of stories is an important task in natural language understanding [[1]](http://anthology.aclweb.org/D/D13/D13-1020.pdf). Specifically, you will develop a model that given a sequence of sentences learns to sort these sentence in order to yield a coherent story [[2]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/short-commonsense-stories.pdf). This sounds (and to an extent is) trivial for humans, however it is quite a difficult task for machines as it involves commonsense knowledge and temporal understanding."

However, be aware that you will need to run these models many times over, for a larger number of epochs (more elaborate models, trained on much larger datasets can train for weeks! However, this shouldn't be the case here.). If you find training times too long for your development cycle you can reduce the training set size. Once you have found a good solution you can increase the size again. Caveat: model parameters tuned on a smaller dataset may not be optimal for a larger training set.\n",

Be aware that these representations might take a lot of parameters in your model. Be sure you use only the words you expect in the training/dev set and account for OOV words. When saving the model parameters, pre-rained word embeddings can simply be used in the word embedding matrix of your model. As said, make sure that this word embedding matrix does not contain all of word2vec or GloVe. Your submission is limited, and we will not allow uploading nor using the whole representations set (up to 3GB!)\n",

    "  - bi-directional RNNs\n",
